Car-Dealership-Reviews-with-Django is a sophisticated web application that leverages the Django web framework to create a platform for car dealership reviews.

* Django Web Framework: This application is built using Django, a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Django takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing this app without needing to reinvent the wheel.

* Car Dealership Reviews: The primary function of this application is to allow users to post and view reviews for various car dealerships. This provides a platform for potential customers to make informed decisions based on the experiences of others.


* Data Management: This application likely uses a relational database system, such as SQLite or PostgreSQL, to store and manage review data. Django’s Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) layer makes it easy to work with this database, wherever you’re using raw SQL, or prefer Django’s database query API.

* User Interface: The user interface of this application is likely built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with Django’s templating engine. This allows users to easily navigate the site, submit new reviews, and read existing ones.

* Authentication and Authorization: Django’s built-in authentication system is used to handle user accounts, registration, and login. This ensures that only authenticated users can post reviews.
